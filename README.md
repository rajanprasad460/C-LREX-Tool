A video demonstration to use the tool can be found on YouTube.


## C-LREX Conceptual Configuration Simulation
The first part of the C-LREX tool involves simulating the conceptual model using a link based modeling approach. This step allows us to create a virtual representation of the C-LREX and examine its behavior. By inputting relevant parameters and variables into the model, we can run simulations and observe how the system responds under different conditions.
Once the simulation is complete, we can analyze the results to gain insights into the system's performance and behavior. This analysis may involve studying various metrics, evaluating the system's response to different inputs, and identifying any patterns or trends that emerge.
To ensure that the results are not lost and can be referred to later, it is crucial to save them for further analysis. This can be done by storing the simulation output in a file or database, making it easily accessible for future reference and comparison. By saving the results, we enable the opportunity for in-depth analysis, validation, and sharing with other researchers or stakeholders.
