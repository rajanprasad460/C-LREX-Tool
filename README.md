## C-LREX Conceptual Configuration Simulation

The first part of the C-LREX tool involves simulating the conceptual model using a link-based modeling approach. This step allows you to create a virtual representation of the C-LREX and examine its behavior. By inputting relevant parameters and variables into the model, you can run simulations and observe how the system responds under different conditions.

Once the simulation is complete, you can analyze the results to gain insights into the system's performance and behavior. This analysis may involve studying various metrics, evaluating the system's response to different inputs, and identifying any patterns or trends that emerge.

To ensure that the results are not lost and can be referred to later, it is crucial to save them for further analysis. This can be done by storing the simulation output in a file or database, making it easily accessible for future reference and comparison. By saving the results, you enable the opportunity for in-depth analysis, validation, and sharing with other researchers or stakeholders.

## Optimal Routing Parameter Estimation

This part focuses on the identification of optimal cable routing parameters for a selected configuration using Monte Carlo simulation. The accuracy of the optimal estimation improves with a higher number of generated samples. By exporting the optimal hinge locations, they can be utilized as an optimal model for correcting stroke impairments.

Monte Carlo simulation is employed to iteratively generate samples and evaluate the performance of different cable routing parameters. This iterative process allows for the exploration of various combinations and configurations to identify the optimal set of parameters. By increasing the number of samples generated, the simulation can provide more accurate estimations and robust results.

The ultimate goal is to determine the cable routing parameters that yield the most effective correction for stroke impairments. These optimal parameters define the precise locations of the hinges, ensuring the optimal configuration for the correction of stroke-induced gait abnormalities. By exporting these optimal hinge locations, they can be utilized in subsequent steps or further analysis as an optimal model for stroke impairment correction.

## Stroke Impairment Correction

This section is dedicated to the correction of stroke impairments through the implementation of the optimal model of C-LREX. The optimal model can be scaled to accommodate different subjects by specifying unique anthropometric information in the General Parameter Definition section. This allows for personalized and tailored correction interventions based on individual characteristics.

The C-LREX model employed here has the capability to simulate gait correction for both sagittal and bi-planar gait impairments. By addressing these specific types of impairments, the model caters to a wide range of stroke survivors with varying gait abnormalities. Through advanced algorithms and techniques, the model analyzes and modifies the walking patterns to enhance functional mobility and restore a more natural gait.
